# facerecognition

A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces. Such a system is typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification services, and works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image
This facial recognition system is build using python language.
It is a user-friendly code which consist of four functions
    -> main.py
    -> train.py
    -> student.py
    ->  face-detection.py


The purpose of this project is to analyze the advantages and disadvantages, problems encountered and solutions found, when using face detection and recognition. A face detection and recognition system would certainly speed up the process of checking student attendance or any of its applications in comparison to other biometrics authentication methods and in the right circumstances it would be able to match their accuracy. Nowadays there are a wide variety of software, whether it is a Face API like Microsoftâ€™s or a library like OpenCV, that makes face detection and recognition accessible and reliable and is constantly improving
